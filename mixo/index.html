      <p>Hello, and welcome to my website.
      My name is Mixo Malepfane, and I'm a programmer from South Africa
      with a strong interest in computer networks, databases and operating systems.
      I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at
      <a href="https://nwu.ac.za" rel="external"> North-West University</a>.
      </p>

      <p>My passion for computers began with video games like
      <i>Grand Theft Auto, FIFA, and Need for Speed</i>.
      I was fascinated by how developers created such immersive virtual
      worlds-experiences that kept me engaged for hours.
      Although I had access to computers from a young age,
      I only started programming when I got to university.
      </p>

      <p>At the time, my degree didn’t include courses on 3D graphics
      or game development. Curious and determined,
      I turned to the internet and began learning OpenGL through
      the <a href="https://open.gl" rel="external">open.gl</a> website.
      I explored game development for a while but quickly realized
      that it was a massive endeavor requiring collaboration across
      many specialized areas. Still, I enjoyed rendering 3D objects for fun.
      It also helped reinforce the mathematical concepts
      I was learning in class.
      </p>

      <p>In my third year, I took courses in operating systems
      and computer networks. That’s when I began to appreciate
      how interconnected software really is.
      Most software isn’t meaningful in isolation,
      it's the networked experience that keeps users engaged.
      I decided to focus more on networking. However,
      I struggled with the university's networking module
      and passed mostly by memorizing material.
      Wanting a deeper understanding, I picked up
      <i>Internetworking with TCP/IP</i> by Douglas Comer.
      It is one of the best books I've ever read.
      </p>

      <p>As I dug deeper into the TCP/IP protocol suite,
      I found myself forgetting earlier concepts.
      A common issue when you read a book and then move on
      without applying it. To truly understand,
      I turned to <i>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2: The Implementation</i>
      by W. Richard Stevens and Gary R. Wright.
      I decided to implement the protocols described in the book.</p>

      <p>But implementing these protocols required a solid understanding
      of operating systems and kernel-level privileges.
      So, I began writing a small operating system kernel.
      It is based on FreeBSD, a descendent of the 4.4BSD-Lite Unix system
      used in the book.
