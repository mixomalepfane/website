      <p>When you start writing software, you quickly see that many programs
      need to connect with other programs to share data. These programs are
      often on different devices, sometimes far away from each other.
      This happens because most people only use offline software for work,
      most apps today need the internet to let people talk to each other or get
      information from somewhere else.
      </p>

      <p>In my third year at university, I chose to learn more about networks.
      But I found the networking course hard and mostly passed by memorizing facts.
      I wanted to really understand it, so I read <i>Internetworking with TCP/IP</i> by
      Douglas Comer. It’s one of the best books I’ve ever read.
      </p>

      <p>As I dug deeper into the TCP/IP protocol suite,
      I found myself forgetting earlier concepts.
      A common issue when you read a book and then move on
      without applying it. To truly understand,
      I turned to <i>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2: The Implementation</i>
      by W. Richard Stevens and Gary R. Wright.
      I decided to implement the protocols described in the book.</p>

      <p>But implementing these protocols required a solid understanding
      of operating systems and kernel-level privileges.
      So, I began writing a small operating system kernel.
      It is based on FreeBSD, a descendent of the 4.4BSD-Lite Unix system
      used in the book.
