      <h2>1.1. Sample Spaces</h2>
      <p>Probability theory is concerned with situations in which the
      outcomes occur randomly. Generically, such situations are called
      <i>experiments</i>, and the set of all possible outcomes is the
      <b>sample space</b> corresponding to an experiment. The sample space
      is denoted by \(\Omega\), and an element of \(\Omega\) is denoted by
      \(\omega\).
      </p>

      <h3>EXAMPLE 1</h3>
      <p>Suppose that a fair coin is thrown 3 times. The sample space is
      the set of all possible outcomes:
      \[\Omega = \{hhh, hht, htt, hth, thh, tht, tth, ttt\ \}\]
      where \(h\) denotes heads and \(t\) tails.
      </p>

      <p>We are often interested in particular subsets of \(\Omega\),
      which are called <b>events</b>. In <b>Example 1</b>, the event that
      the first coin toss results in heads \(h\) is
      \[A = \{hhh, hht, hth, htt\ \}\]
      </p>

      <p>The <b>union</b> of two events, \(A\) and \(B\), is the event \(C\)
      that either \(A\) occurs or \(B\) occurs or both occur:
      \[C = A \cup B\]
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="../../images/statistics/f1.1a.png" alt="figure 1.1a" class="figures"/>
      </div>

      <p>From <b>example 1</b>, if \(A\) is the event that the first coin toss is
      heads \(h\) and \(B\) the event that the last is tails \(t\) , then
      \[A = \{hhh, hht, hth, htt\ \}\]
      \[B = \{hht, htt, tht, ttt\ \}\]
      \[A \cup B = \{hhh, hht, hth, htt, tht, ttt\ \}\]
      </p>

      <p>The <b>intersection</b> of two events, \(A\) and \(B\),
      is the event \(C\) that both \(A\) and \(B\) occur:
      \[C = A \cap B\]
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="../../images/statistics/f1.1b.png" alt="figure 1.1b" class="figures"/>
      </div>

      <p>If \(A\) and \(B\) are as given previously, then \(C\) consists
      of those outcomes that are common to both \(A\) and \(B\):
      \[C = A \cap B = \{htt, hht\ \}\]
      </p>

      <p>The <b>complement</b> of an event, \(A^c\), is the event that
      \(A\) does not occur and thus consists of all those elements
      in the sample space that are not in \(A\) .
      The complement of the event that the first coin tossed is heads:
      \[A^c = \{thh, tht, tth, ttt\ \}\]
      </p>

      <p>The <b>empty set</b>, usually denoted by \(\emptyset\) , is the
      set with no elements. It is the event with no outcomes.
      For example, if \(A\) is the event that the first toss is heads and
      \(D\) the event that all tosses are tails, then
      \(A\) and \(D\) have no outcomes in common, and we can write
      \[A \cap D = \empty\]
      In such cases, \(A\) and \(D\) are said to be <b>disjoint</b>.
      </p>

      <p>The following are some laws of set theory.<br>
      <b>Commutative Laws</b>:
      \[A \cup B = B \cup A\]
      \[A \cap B = B \cap A\]
      <b>Associative Laws</b>:
      \[(A \cup B\ ) \cup C = A \cup\ (B \cup C\ )\]
      \[(A \cap B\ ) \cap C = A \cap\ (B \cap C\ )\]
      <b>Distributive Laws</b>:
      \[(A \cup B\ ) \cap C = (A \cap C\ ) \cup\ (B \cap C\ )\]
      \[(A \cap B\ ) \cup C = (A \cup C\ ) \cap\ (B \cup C\ )\]
