      <h2>1.1. Sample Spaces</h2>
      <p>Probability theory is concerned with situations in which the
      outcomes occur randomly. Generically, such situations are called
      <b>experiments</b>, and the set of all possible outcomes is the
      <b>sample space</b> corresponding to an experiment. The sample space
      is denoted by \(\Omega\), and an element of \(\Omega\) is denoted by
      \(\omega\).
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE A</h4>
      <p>Toss a coin \[\Omega = \{h, t\}\]</p>
      <p>Roll a die \[\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\]</p>
      <p>Toss a coin twice \[\Omega = \{hh, ht, th, tt\}\]</p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE B</h4>
      <p>Driving to work, a commuter passes through a sequence of three
      intersections with trafﬁc lights. At each light, she either stops, \(s\),
      or continues, \(c\). The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes:
      \[\Omega = \{ccc, ccs, css, csc, sss, ssc, scc, scs\}\]
      where \(csc\), for example, denotes the outcome that the commuter continues
      through the ﬁrst light, stops at the second light,
      and continues through the third light.
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE C</h4>
      <p>The number of jobs in a print queue of a mainframe computer may be modeled as
      random. Here the sample space can be taken as \[\Omega = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}\]
      that is, all the nonnegative integers. In practice,
      there is probably an upper limit, N , on how large the print queue can be,
      so instead the sample space might be deﬁned as
      \[\Omega = \{0, 1, 2, \dots, N\}\]
      </p>

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>An <b>event</b> is a subset of the sample space.</p>

      <p>In <b>Example B</b>, the event that the commuter stops at the ﬁrst light is
      the subset of \(\Omega\) denoted by
      \[A = \{sss, ssc, scc, scs\}\]
      </p>

      <p>In <b>Example C</b>, the event that there are fewer than ﬁve jobs in the print
      queue can be denoted by \[A = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\]
      </p>

      <h3>Union</h3>
      <p>The <b>union</b> of two events, \(A\) and \(B\), is the event \(A \cup B\)
      that either \(A\) occurs or \(B\) occurs or both occur.
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="../../images/statistics/f1.1a.png" alt="figure 1.1a" class="figures"/>
      </div>

      <p>From <b>Example B</b>, if \(A\) is the event that the commuter stops at
      the ﬁrst light, and if \(B\) is the event that she stops at the third light,
      \[A = \{sss, ssc, scc, scs\}\]
      \[B = \{sss, scs, ccs, css\}\]
      then \(A\cup B\) is the event that she stops at the ﬁrst light or stops at the third
      light and consists of the outcomes that are in \(A\) or in \(B\) or in both
      \[A \cup B = \{sss, ssc, scc, scs, ccs, css\}\]
      </p>

      <h3>Intersection</h3>
      <p>The <b>intersection</b> of two events, \(A\) and \(B\),
      is the event \(A \cap B\) that both \(A\) and \(B\) occur.
      </p>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="../../images/statistics/f1.1b.png" alt="figure 1.1b" class="figures"/>
      </div>

      <p>From <b>Example B</b>, if \(A\) is the event that the commuter stops at
      the ﬁrst light, and if \(B\) is the event that she stops at the third light,
      \[A = \{sss, ssc, scc, scs\}\]
      \[B = \{sss, scs, ccs, css\}\]
      then \(A\cap B\) is the event that she stops at the ﬁrst light or stops at the third
      light and consists of the outcomes that are in \(A\) or in \(B\) or in both
      \[A \cap B = \{sss, scs\}\]
      </p>

      <h3>Complement</h3>
      <p>The <b>complement</b> of an event, \(A^c\), is the event that
      \(A\) does not occur and thus consists of all those elements
      in the sample space that are not in \(A\) .
      </p>

      <p>From <b>Example B</b>, the complement of the event that the commuter stops
      at the ﬁrst light is the event that she continues at the ﬁrst light:
      \[A^c = \{ccc, ccs, css, csc\}\]
      </p>

      <h3>Empty Set</h3>
      <p>The <b>empty set</b>, usually denoted by \(\emptyset\) , is the
      set with no elements. It is the event with no outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>From <b>Example B</b>, if \(A\) is the event that the commuter stops at the
      ﬁrst light and \(C\) is the event that she continues through all three lights,
      \(C = \{ccc\}\), then \(A\) and \(C\) have no outcomes in common, and we can write
      \[A \cap C = \empty\]
      In such cases, \(A\) and \(C\) are said to be <b>disjoint</b>.
      </p>

      <h3>Laws From Set Theory</h3>
      <p><b>Commutative Laws</b>:
      \[A \cup B = B \cup A\]
      \[A \cap B = B \cap A\]
      <b>Associative Laws</b>:
      \[(A \cup B\ ) \cup C = A \cup\ (B \cup C\ )\]
      \[(A \cap B\ ) \cap C = A \cap\ (B \cap C\ )\]
      <b>Distributive Laws</b>:
      \[(A \cup B\ ) \cap C = (A \cap C\ ) \cup\ (B \cap C\ )\]
      \[(A \cap B\ ) \cup C = (A \cup C\ ) \cap\ (B \cup C\ )\]
