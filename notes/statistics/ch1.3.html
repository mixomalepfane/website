      <h2>1.3. Computing Probabilities: Counting Methods</h2>
      <p>Suppose we have an experiment where the sample space
      \(\Omega\) has a finite number of elements,
      \(\Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \dots, \omega_N\}\) .
      Suppose further that each element \(\Omega\) has the same
      probability of occuring: 
      \[P(\{\omega_i\}) = \frac{1}{N}\]
      </p>

      <p>Suppose \(A\) is the event \(A = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \dots, \omega_k\}\) .
      Then \[P(A\ ) = \frac{number\ of\ elements\ in\ A}{number\ of\ elements\ in\ \Omega}
      = \frac{k}{N}\]
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE A</h4>
      <p>Suppose that a fair coin is thrown twice and the sequence of heads
      and tails is recorded. The sample space is
      \[\Omega = \{hh, ht, th, tt\}\]
      As in Example A of the previous section,
      we assume that each outcome in \(\Omega\) has probability \(0.25\).
      Let \(A\) denote the event that at least one head is thrown.
      Then \[A = \{hh, ht, th\}\] and \[P(A\ ) = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75\]
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>The Multiplication Principle</h3>
      <p>If one experiment has \(m\) outcomes and another
      experiment has \(n\) outcomes, then there are \(mn\) possible
      outcomes for the two experiments.
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE B</h4>
      <p>Playing cards have \(13\) face values and \(4\) suits.
      There are thus \[4 × 13 = 52\] face value/suit combinations.
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE C</h4>
      <p>A class has \(12\) boys and \(18\) girls.
      The teacher selects \(1\) boy and \(1\) girl to act as
      representatives to the student government.
      She can do this in any of \[12 × 18 = 216\] different ways.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>The Extended Multiplication Principle</h3>
      <p>If there are \(p\) experiments and the ﬁrst has \(n_1\) possible outcomes,
      the second \(n_2\ , \dots, \) and the \(p\) th with \(n_p\) possible outcomes,
      then there are a total of \[n_1 × n_2 × \dots × n_p\]
      possible outcomes for the \(p\) experiments.
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE D</h4>
      <p>An \(8\)-bit binary word is a sequence of \(8\) digits,
      of which each may be either a \(0\) or a \(1\).
      How many different \(8\)-bit words are there?
      </p>

      <p>There are two choices for the ﬁrst bit, two for the second,
      etc., and thus there are \[2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2=2^8=256\]such words.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Permutations</h3>
      <p>A <b>permutation</b> is an ordered arrangement of objects.
      </p>
      <p>Suppose that from the set \(C = \{c_1 , c_2 , \dots, c_n \}\)
      we choose \(r\) elements and list them in order. How many ways can we do this?
      The answer depends on whether we are allowed to duplicate items in the list.
      If no duplication is allowed, we are <b>sampling without replacement</b>.
      If duplication is allowed, we are <b>sampling with replacement</b>.
      </p>

      <h4>PROPOSITION A</h4>
      <p>For a set of size \(n\) and a sample of size \(r\) , there are
      \[n×n×\dots×n = n^{\ r}\] different ordered <b>samples with replacement</b>
      and \[n\ (n − 1)\ (n − 2) \dots (n − r + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n-r\ )!}\] different ordered
      <b>samples without replacement</b>.
      </p>

      <h4>COROLLARY A</h4>
      <p>The number of orderings of \(n\) elements is
      \[n\ (n − 1)\ (n − 2) \dots 1 = n!\]
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE E</h4>
      <p>How many ways can ﬁve children be lined up?
      </p>

      <p>This corresponds to <b>sampling without replacement</b>.
      According to Corollary A, there are
      \[5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\] different lines.
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE F</h4>
      <p>Suppose that from ten children, ﬁve are to be chosen and lined up.
      How many different lines are possible?
      </p>

      <p> From Proposition A,
      there are \[10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 = 30,240\] different lines.
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE G</h4>
      <p>In some states, license plates have six characters:
      three letters followed by three numbers.
      How many distinct such plates are possible?
      </p>

      <p>This corresponds to <b>sampling with replacement</b>.
      </p>
      
      <p>There are \(26^3 = 17,576\) different
      ways to choose the letters and \(10^3 = 1000\) ways to choose the numbers.
      Using the multiplication principle again,
      we ﬁnd there are \[17,576 × 1000 = 17,576,000\] different plates.
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE H: Birthday Problem</h4>
      <p>Suppose that a room contains \(n\) people.
      What is the probability that at least two of them have a common birthday?
      </p>

      <p>This is a famous problem with a counterintuitive answer.
      Assume that every day of the year is equally likely to be a birthday,
      disregard leap years, and denote by \(A\) the event that at least
      two people have a common birthday.
      </p>

      <p>As is sometimes the case, ﬁnding \(P(A^c\ )\) is easier than ﬁnding \(P(A\ )\) .
      This is because \(A\) can happen in many ways, whereas \(A^c\ \) is much simpler.
      There are \(365^n\) possible outcomes, and \(A^c\) can happen in
      \[365 × 364 × \dots × (365 − n + 1)\] ways. Thus,
      \[P(A^c\ ) = \frac{365 × 364 × \dots × (365 − n + 1)}{365^n}\]
      and \[P(A\ ) = 1 - \frac{365 × 364 × \dots × (365 − n + 1)}{365^n}\]
      </p>

      The following table exhibits the latter probabilities for various values of \(n\)
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>\(n\)</th>
            <th>\(P(A\ )\)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>4</td><td>0.016</td></tr>
          <tr><td>16</td><td>0.284</td></tr>
          <tr><td>23</td><td>0.507</td></tr>
          <tr><td>32</td><td>0.753</td></tr>
          <tr><td>40</td><td>0.891</td></tr>
          <tr><td>56</td><td>0.988</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>From the table, we see that if there are only \(23\) people,
      the probability of at least one match exceeds \(0.5\).
      The probabilities in the table are larger than one might intuitively guess,
      showing that the coincidence is not unlikely.
      </p>

      <h3>Combinations</h3>
      <p>A <b>combination</b> is an unordered set of elements.
      </p>
      
      <p>If \(r\) objects are taken from a set of \(n\) objects without
      replacement and disregarding order, how many different samples are possible?
      </p>

      <p>From the multiplication principle, the number of ordered samples equals the
      number of unordered samples multiplied by the number of ways to order each sample.
      Since the number of ordered samples is \[n\ (n − 1) \dots (n − r + 1)\]
      and since a sample of size \(r\) can be ordered in \(r\ !\) ways (Corollary A),
      the number of unordered samples is
      \[\frac{n(n − 1) \dots (n − r + 1)}{r\ !} = \frac{n!}{(n − r\ )!\ r\ !}\]
      This number is also denoted as \(\binom{n\ }{r\ } \) .
      </p>

      <h4>Important Properties of \(\binom{n\ }{r\ }\)</h4>
      <p>\[1.\ \ \binom{n\ }{r\ } = \frac{n!}{r\ !\ (n-r\ )!} = \binom{n}{n-r\ }\]
      \[2.\ \ \binom{n\ }{1\ } = \frac{n!}{1!\ (n-1\ )!} = n\]
      \[3.\ \ \binom{n\ }{0\ } = \frac{n!}{0!\ (n-0)!} = \frac{1}{0!} = 1\]
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE I</h4>
      <p>A cage contains \(100\) mice numbered \(1\) to \(100\) in order to identify each one.
      In how many ways can \(12\) mice be randomly drawn from the cage?
      \[\binom{100\ }{12\ } = \frac{100!}{(100 - 12)!\ 12!}\]
      \[ = 1\ 050\ 421\ 051\ 106\ 700\]
      </p>

      <h4>PROPOSITION C</h4>
      <p>The number of ways that \(n\) objects can be grouped into \(r\) classes
      with \(n_i\) in the \(i\) th class, \(i = 1, \dots , r\) , and
      \(\sum^{r}_{i\ = 1} n_i = n\) is
      \[\binom{n}{n_1\ n_2\ \dots\ n_r\ } = \frac{n!}{n_1!\ n_2!\ \dots\ n_r!}\]
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE J</h4>
      <p>A committee of seven members is to be divided into three subcommittees of size
      three, two, and two. This can be done in
      \[\binom{7}{3\ \ 2\ \ 2} = \frac{7}{3!\ \ 2!\ \ 2!} = 210\] ways.
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE K</h4>
      <p>In how many ways can the set of nucleotides
      \(\{A, A, G, G, G, G, C, C, C\}\) be arranged in a sequence of nine letters?
      </p>

      <p>Proposition C can be applied by realizing that this problem can be cast
      as determining the number of ways that the nine positions in the sequence
      can be divided into subgroups of sizes two, four, and three
      (the locations of the letters A, G, and C):
      \[\binom{9}{2\ \ 4\ \ 3} = \frac{9!}{2!\ \ 4!\ \ 3!} = 1260\]
