      <h2>1.4. Conditional Probability</h2>
      <p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two events with \(P(B\ )\ \rlap{\,/}{=}\ 0\) .
      The conditional probability of \(A\) given \(B\) is defined to be
      \[P(A\ |B\ ) = \frac{P(A \cap B\ )}{P(B\ )}\]
      By rewriting the definition, we get
      \[P(A \cap B\ ) = P(A\ |B\ )\ P(B\ )\]
      </p>

      <h4>Example A</h4>
      <p>Throw a die and let \(A\) be the event of obtaining an even number
      and let \(B\) be the event of obtaining a number larger than \(3\).
      \[\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\]
      </p>

      <p>Determine the probability of obtaining a number larger than \(3\).
      \[B = \{4, 5, 6\}\]
      \[P(B\ ) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\]
      </p>

      <p>Determine the probability of obtaining a number larger than \(3\),
      given that the die shows an even number.
      \[A = \{2, 4, 6\}\]
      \[ A \cap B = \{4, 6\}\]
      \[P(A\ |B\ ) = \frac{P(A \cap B\ )}{P(B\ )}\]
      \[= \frac{\ \frac{2}{6}\ }{\frac{3}{6}} = \frac{2}{3}\]
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE B</h4>
      <p>An urn contains three red balls and one blue ball.
      Two balls are selected without replacement.
      What is the probability that they are both red?
      </p>

      <p>Let \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) denote the events that a red ball is
      drawn on the ﬁrst trial and on the second trial, respectively. Then
      \[P(R_1\ ) = \frac{3}{4}\] and if a red ball has been
      removed on the ﬁrst trial, there are two red balls and one blue ball left.
      Therefore, \[P(R_2\ |R_1\ ) = \frac{2}{3}\]
      From the multiplication law, \[P(R_1 \cap R_2\ ) = P(R_1\ )\ P(R_2\ |R_1\ )\]
      \[= \frac{3}{4} * \frac{2}{3}\]
      \[= \frac{1}{2}\]
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE C</h4>
      <p>Suppose the probability that it is raining \(A\) given that it is cloudy
      \(B\) is \[P(A\ |B\ ) = \frac{1}{3}\] and that the probability that it is cloudy is
      \[P(B\ )=\frac{1}{5}\] What the probability that it is cloudy and raining?
      \[P(A \cap B\ ) = P(A\ |B\ )\ P(B\ )\]
      \[= \frac{1}{3} * \frac{1}{5}\]
      \[= \frac{1}{15}\]
      </p>

      <h4>EXAMPLE D</h4>
      <p>Two dice are rolled. Let \(A\) be the event that the sum of the values
      facing up on the dice is equal to seven, and let \(B\) be the event that
      the first die has the value six facing up.
      Determine \(P(A\ |B\ )\) and \(P(B\ |A\ )\).
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Out of the combinations that give the sum \(7\):
      \[(1;6),(2;5),(3;4),(4;3),(5;2),(6;1)\]
      only \((6;1)\) has the first die as \(6\). So,
      \[P(B\ |A\ ) = \frac{1}{6}\]
 
      Out of the combinations that give \(6\) as the first die:
      \[(6;1),(6;2),(6;3),(6;4),(6;5),(6;6)\]
      only \((6;1)\) has a sum of \(7\). So,\[P(A\ |B\ ) = \frac{1}{6}\]

      <h3>Law Of Total Probability</h3>
      <p>Let \(B_1 , B_2 , \dots, B_n\) be such that \[\cup^{n}_{i\ =1} B_i = \Omega\]
      \[B_i \cap B_j = \empty\ for\ i\ \rlap{\,/}{=}\ j\]
      \[P(B_i\ ) > 0\ ,i = 1, 2, \dots, n\] Then, for any event \(A\) ,
      \[P(A\ ) = \sum^{n}_{i\ =1} P(A\ |B_i\ )\ P(B_i\ )\]
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Bayes' Rule</h3>
      <p>Let \(A\) and \(B_1 , \dots, B_n\) be events where the \(B_i\) are disjoint,
      \(\cup^{n}_{i\ =1} B_i = \Omega\) , and \(P(B_i\ ) > 0\) for all \(i\) . Then
      \[P(B_j\ |A\ )=\frac{P(A\ |B_j\ )\ P(B_j\ )}{\sum^{n}_{i\ =1}P(A\ |B_i\ )\ P(B_i\ )}\]
