        Chapter 2: Motion Along a Straight Line
      </h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      One purpose of physics is to study the motion of objects—how
      fast they move and how far they travel in a given amount of time.
      NASCAR engineers are fanatical about this aspect of physics as
      they determine the performance of their cars before and during a race.
      In this chapter, we study motion along a single axis,
      called <i>one-dimensional motion</i>.

      <h2>2-1 Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity</h2>

      <h3>Position</h3>
      <p>
        The <i>position</i> \(x\) of a particle on an \(x\)-axis locates
        it with respect to the <b>origin</b> (zero point).
        Position is positive or negative depending on the side of
        the origin, or zero if at the origin.
        The <b>positive direction</b> is toward increasing values;
        the opposite is the <b>negative direction</b>.
        Position is measured in meters (m).
      </p>

      <h3>Displacement</h3>
      <p>
        The <i>displacement</i> \(\Delta x\) is the change in position:
        \[\Delta x = x_2 - x_1\]
        Displacement is a vector quantity and measured in meters (m).
      </p>

      <h3>Average Velocity</h3>
      <p>
        If a particle moves from \(x_1\) to \(x_2\) over
        \(\Delta t = t_2 - t_1\), its average velocity is:
        \[v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}\]
        The sign of \(v_{avg}\) indicates direction. Average velocity depends
        on initial and final positions, not path length.
      </p>
      <p>
        On an \(x\) vs. \(t\) graph, average velocity equals the slope
        of the straight line connecting the two endpoints.
        It is measured in meters per second (m·s<sup>-1</sup>).
      </p>

      <h3>Average Speed</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Average speed</i> \(s_{avg}\) is based on the total distance
        traveled over time: \[s_{avg} = \frac{total\ distance}{\Delta t}\]
        It is a scalar, measured in meters per second (m·s<sup>-1</sup>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Topic2">
      <h2>2-2 Instantaneous Velocity and Speed</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Instantaneous velocity</i> \(v\) is the rate of change of
        position at a specific instant: \[v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}
        \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}\]
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Speed</b> is the magnitude of velocity.
      Both are measured in meters per second (m·s<sup>-1</sup>).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Topic3">
      <h2>2-3 Acceleration</h2>

      <h3>Average Acceleration</h3>
      <p>
        Defined as the change in velocity over time:
        \[a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\]
        where \(v_1\) is the velocity at time \(t_1\) and \(v_2\) at time \(t_2\).
        Measured in meters per second squared (m·s<sup>-2</sup>).
      </p>

      <h3>Instantaneous Acceleration</h3>
      <p>
      The <i>instantaneous acceleration</i> (or simply acceleration)
      \(a\) is the rate at which velocity is changing at that instant.
        \[a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^{\ 2}x}{dt^{\ 2}}\]
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Topic4">
      <h2>2-4 Constant Acceleration</h2>
      <p>The following equations describe motion under constant acceleration:</p>
        \[v = v_0 + at\]
        \[v^{\ 2} = v_0^{\ 2} + 2a\ (x - x_0)\]
        \[x - x_0 = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^{\ 2}\]
        \[x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v)t\]
        \[x - x_0 = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^{\ 2}\]
      <p>These equations apply only when acceleration is constant.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Topic5">
      <h2>2-5 FREE-FALL ACCELERATION</h2>
      <p>An important example of straight-line motion with constant
      acceleration is that of an object rising or falling freely near
      Earth’s surface. The constant acceleration equations describe
      this motion, but we make two changes in notation:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>We refer the motion to the vertical \(y\) axis with
        \(+y\) vertically up.
        </li>
        <li>We replace \(a\) with \(-g\), where \(g\)
        is the magnitude of the free-fall acceleration.
        Near Earth’s surface, \(g = 9.8\) m·s<sup>-2</sup>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Note: free-fall acceleration near Earth’s surface is
      \(a = -g = -9.8\) m·s<sup>-2</sup>, and the magnitude of the acceleration
      is \(g = 9.8\) m·s<sup>-2</sup>.
      Do not substitute \(-9.8\) m·s<sup>-2</sup> for \(g\) .
      </p>

      <h2>2-6 GRAPHICAL INTEGRATION IN MOTION ANALYSIS</h2>
  
      <h3>Change in velocity</h3>
      <p>On a graph of acceleration \(a\) versus time \(t\) ,
      the <i>change in the velocity</i> is given by
      \(v_1 - v_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} a \ dt\)<br>
      The integral amounts to finding an area on the graph:
