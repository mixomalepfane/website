  <h1>Chapter 2: Motion Along a Straight Line</h1>
  <p>One purpose of physics is to study the motion of objects,
  how fast they move and how far they move in a given amount of time.
  NASCAR engineers are fanatical about this aspect of physics
  as they determine the performance of their cars before and during a race.
  In this chapter, we study the basic physics of motion where the object moves
  along a single axis. Such motion is called <i>one-dimensional motion</i>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Topic1">2-1 POSITION, DISPLACEMENT, AND AVERAGE VELOCITY</h2>
  <h3>Position</h3>
  <p>The <i>position</i> \(x\) of a particle on an \(x\) axis locates the particle
  with respect to the <b>origin</b>, or zero point, of the axis.The position
  is either positive or negative, according to which side of the origin the
  particle is on, or zero if the particle is at the origin. The <b>positive
  direction</b> on an axis is the direction of increasing positive numbers,
  the opposite direction is the <b>negative direction</b> on the axis.
  Position is measured in meters ( \(m\) ).
  </p>

  <h3>Displacement</h3>
  <p>The <i>displacement</i> \(\Delta x\) of a particle is the 
  change in its position: \[\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 \]
  </p>

  <p>Displacement is a vector quantity. It is positive if the particle has
  moved in the positive direction of the \(x\) axis and negative if the
  particle has moved in the negative direction.
  Dispalcement is measured in meters ( \(m\) ).
  </p>

  <h3>Average Velocity</h3>
  <p>When a particle has moved from position \(x_1\)
  to position \(x_2\) during a time interval \(\Delta t = t_2 - t_1\),
  its average velocity during that interval
  is: \[v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}\]
  </p>

  <p>The algebraic sign of \(v_{avg}\) indicates the
  direction of motion (\(v_{avg}\) is a vector quantity).
  Average velocity does not depend on the actual distance a particle moves,
  but instead depends on its original and final positions.
  </p>
  
  <p>On a graph of \(x\) versus \(t\) , the average velocity for a time
  interval \(\Delta t\) is the slope of the straight line connecting
  the points on the curve that represent the two ends of the interval.
  Avarage velocity is measured in meters per second ( \(m.s^{\ -1}\) ).
  </p>

  <h3>Average Speed</h3>
  <p><i>The average speed</i> \(s_{avg}\) of a particle during a
  time interval \(\Delta t\) depends on the total distance the
  particle moves in that time
  interval: \[s_{avg} = \frac{total\ distance}{\Delta t}\]
  <br>Average speed does not include direction.
  It is measured in meters per second ( \(m.s^{\ -1}\) ).
  </p>

  <h2 id="Topic2">2-2 INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED</h2>
  <p>The <i>instantaneous velocity</i> (or simply <b>velocity</b>)
  \(v\) refers to how fast a particle is moving at a given
  instant: \[v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}\]
  where the <i>displacement</i> \(\Delta x = x_2 - x_1\) and
  <i>time interval</i> \(\Delta t = t_2 - t_1\) .
  </p>

  <p><b>Speed</b> is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity.
  Both speed and velocity are measured in meters per second ( \(m.s^{\ -1}\) ) .
  </p>

  <h2 id="Topic3">2-3 ACCELERATION</h2>
  <p>When a particle’s velocity changes,
  the particle is said to undergo acceleration (or to accelerate).
  </p>

  <h3>Average acceleration</h3>
  <p><i>Average acceleration</i> is the ratio of a change in velocity
  \(\Delta v\) to the time interval \(\Delta t\) in which the change
  occurs. \[a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}\]
  where the particle has velocity \(v_1\) at time \(t_1\)
  and then velocity \(v_2\) at time \(t_2\) .
  Avarage velocity is measured in meters per second squared ( \(m.s^{\ -2}\) ).
  </p>

  <h3>Instantaneous acceleration</h3>
  <p><i>Instantaneous acceleration</i> (or simply <b>acceleration</b>) \(a\) is
  the rate at which its velocity is changing at that instant.
  \[a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^{\ 2}x}{dt^{\ 2}}\]
  </p>

  <h2 id="Topic4">2-4 CONSTANT ACCELERATION</h2>
  <p>The following five equations describe the motion of a particle
  with constant acceleration:
  \[v = v_0 + at\]
  \[v^{\ 2} = v_{0}^{\ 2} + 2 a\ (x - x_0)\]
  \[x - x_0 = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} at^{\ 2}\]
  \[x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2} (v_0 + v)t\]
  \[x - x_0 = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^{\ 2}\]
  These equations are not valid when the acceleration is not constant.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="Topic5">2-5 FREE-FALL ACCELERATION</h2>
  <p>An important example of straight-line motion with constant
  acceleration is that of an object rising or falling freely near
  Earth’s surface. The constant acceleration equations describe
  this motion, but we make two changes in notation:<br><br>
  (1) we refer the motion to the vertical \(y\) axis with
  \(+y\) vertically up.<br><br>
  (2) we replace \(a\) with \(-g\), where \(g\)
  is the magnitude of the free-fall acceleration.
  Near Earth’s surface, \(g = 9.8 m.s^{\ 2}\).
  </p>

  <p>Note: free-fall acceleration near Earth’s surface is
  \(a = -g = -9.8 \ m.s^{\ -2}\) , and the magnitude of the acceleration
  is <br> \(g = 9.8 \ m.s^{\ -2}\) .
  Do not substitute \(-9.8\ m.s^{\ -2}\) for \(g\) .
  </p>

  <h2 id="Topic6">2-6 GRAPHICAL INTEGRATION IN MOTION ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p>On a graph of acceleration \(a\) versus time \(t\) , the change in
  the velocity is given by<br><br>
  \(v_1 - v_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} a \ dt\) <br><br>
  The integral amounts to finding an area on the graph:<br><br>
  \( \int_{t_0}^{t_1} a \ dt = (\) area between acceleration
  curve and time axis, from \(t_0\) to \(t_1)\)

  position is given by<br><br> \(x_1 - x_0 = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} v \ dt\)
  <br><br> The integral amounts to finding an area on the graph:<br><br>
