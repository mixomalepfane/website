  <h1>Chapter 1: Measurement</h1>
  <p>Physics is based on measurement of physical quantities.
  Certain physical quantities have been chosen as base quantities
  (such as length, time, and mass); 
  each has been defined in terms of a standard and given a 
  unit of measure (such as meter, second, and kilogram).
  Other physical quantities are defined in terms of the 
  base quantities and their standards and units.
  </p>

  <h2>Length</h2>
  <p>Length is measured in meters(m).
  The meter is the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum
  during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.
  This time interval was chosen so that the speed of light c is exactly
  c = 299 792 458 m.s<sup>-1</sup>.
  </p>

  <h2>Time</h2>
  <p>Time is measured in seconds(s). The second is defined in terms
  of the oscillations of light emitted by an atomic (cesium-133) source.
  </p>

  <h2>Mass</h2>
  <p>Mass is measured in kilograms(kg).
  The kilogram is defined in terms of a platinumâ€“iridium standard
  mass kept near Paris. For measurements on an atomic scale,
  the atomic mass unit, defined in terms of the atom carbon-12,
  is usually used.
  </p>

  <h2>Density</h2>
  Density is measured in kg.m<sup>-3</sup>.
  The density <i>p</i> of a material is the mass per unit volume:<br>
