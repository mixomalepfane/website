      <h2>1.2. Row Reduction and Echelon Forms</h2>

      <h3>Row Echelon Form</h3>
      <p>A <b>zero row</b> in a matrix is a row where each entry in the row is zero.
      A <b>non-zero row</b> in a matrix is a row which contains at least one
      non-zero entry. A <b>leading entry</b> in a non-zero row is the first
      non-zero entry in that row (reading from left to right).
      </p>

      We say that a matrix is in <b>row echelon form</b> (or <b>echelon form</b>)
      if it satisfies the following conditions:
      <ul>
        <li><p>All the non-zero rows are above the zero rows.<p></li>
        <li><p>Every leading entry in a row is in a column to the right of the
          leading entry in the row above it.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros.</p></li>
      </ul>

      We say that a matrix is in <b>reduced row echelon form</b>
      (or <b>reduced echelon form</b>) if it is firstly in row echelon form and
      then further satisfies the following conditions:
      <ul>
        <li><p>Each leading entry in a non-zero row is 1 (called a <b>leading 1</b>).</p></li>
        <li><p>Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in its column.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Theorem 1</b><br>Every matrix is row-equivalent to a unique
      (i.e. one and only one) matrix which is in reduced row echelon form.
      </p>

      <h3>Solutions of a Linear System</h3>
      <p>A <b>pivot position</b> of a matrix \(A\) is a position in \(A\) which
      corresponds to the position of a leading 1 in the reduced row echelon
      form of \(A\). A <b>pivot column</b> of \(A\) is a column of \(A\) which
      contains a pivot position.
      </p>

      <p>The variables in a linear system which correspond to pivot
      columns in the augmented matrix of the linear system are called
      the <b>leading variables</b> (or the <b>basic variables</b>).
      The remaining variables are called <b>free variables</b>.
      </p>

      <p><b>Theorem 2</b><br>
      A linear system is consistent (i.e. has a solution) if and ony if the right-most
      column of the augmented matrix of the system is <b>NOT</b> a pivot column,
      that is, if and only if the augmented matrix has no row of the form
      \[\begin{bmatrix}0 & \dots & 0 & b\end{bmatrix}\] with with b nonzero.
      If a linear system is consistent, then the solution set contains either
      <ul>
        <li><p>a unique solution, if there are no free variables.</p></li>
        <li><p>infinitely many solutions, if there is at least one free variable.</p></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
