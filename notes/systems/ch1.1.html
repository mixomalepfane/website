      <h2>1.1. Memory Model</h2>
      <p>The x86_64 architecture memory model is designed to allow system software
      to manage application software and associated data in a secure fashion.
      The memory model is backward-compatible with the legacy memory model.
      </p>
      
      <p>Hardware-translation mechanisms are provided to map addresses between
      virtual-memory space and physical-memory space. The translation mechanisms
      allow system software to relocate applications and data transparently,
      either anywhere in physical-memory space, or in areas on the system
      hard drive managed by the operating system.
      </p>

      <h3>1.1.1 Memory Addressing</h3>
      <p>The x86_64 architecture supports address relocation. To do this, several
      types of addresses are needed to completely describe memory organization.
      Specifically, four types of addresses are defined by the x86_64 architecture:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Logical addresses</li>
        <li>Effective addresses</li>
        <li>Linear (virtual) addresses</li>
        <li>Physical addresses</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Logical Addresses</h4>
      <p>A <i>logical address</i> is a reference into a segmented-address space.
      It is comprised of the segment selector and the effective address.
      Notationally, a logical address is represented as
      </p>
      <p><i>Logical Address = Segment Selector : Offset</i></p>

      <p>The segment selector specifies an entry in either the global or local
      descriptor table. The specified descriptor-table entry describes the segment
      location in virtual-address space, its size, and other characteristics.
      The effective address is used as an offset into the segment specified
      by the selector.
      </p>

      <p>Logical addresses are often referred to as <i>far pointers</i>.
      Far pointers are used in software addressing when the segment reference
      must be explicit (i.e., a reference to a segment outside the current segment).
      </p>

      <h4>Effective Addresses</h4>
      <p>The offset into a memory segment is referred to as an effective address.
      Effective addresses are formed by adding together elements comprising
      a base value, a scaled-index value, and a displacement value.
      The effective-address computation is represented by the equation
      </p>
      <p><i>Effective Address = Base + (Scale x Index) + Displacement</i></p>

      <p>The elements of an effective-address computation are defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Base</i> — A value stored in any general-purpose register.</li>
        <li><i>Scale</i> — A positive value of 1, 2, 4, or 8.</li>
        <li><i>Index</i> — A two’s-complement value stored in any general-purpose
          register.</li>
        <li><i>Displacement</i> — An 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit two’s-complement
          value encoded as part of the instruction.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Effective addresses are often referred to as <i>near pointers</i>.
      A near pointer is used when the segment selector is known implicitly
      or when the flat-memory model is used.
      </p>

      <h4>Linear (Virtual) Addresses</h4>
      <p>The segment-selector portion of a logical address specifies a
      segment-descriptor entry in either the global or local descriptor table.
      The specified segment-descriptor entry contains the segment-base address,
      which is the starting location of the segment in linear-address space.
      A <i>linear address</i> is formed by adding the segment-base address
      to the effective address (segment offset), which creates a reference
      to any byte location within the supported linear-address space.
      </p>

      <p><i>Linear Address = Segment Base Address + Effective Address</i></p>

      <h4>Physical Addresses</h4>
      <p>A <i>physical address</i> is a reference into the physical-address space,
      typically main memory. Physical addresses are translated from virtual
      addresses using page-translation mechanisms. When the paging mechanism
      is not enabled, the virtual (linear) address is used as the physical address.
      </p>

      <h3>1.1.2 Memory Organization</h3>
      <p>The x86_64 architecture organizes memory into <i>virtual memory</i> and
      <i>physical memory</i>. Virtual-memory and physical-memory spaces can be
      (and usually are) different in size. Generally, the virtual-address
      space is much larger than physical-address memory.
      </p>

      <p>System software relocates applications and data between physical memory
      and the system hard disk to make it appear that much more memory is available
      than really exists. System software then uses the hardware memory-management
      mechanisms to map the larger virtual-address space into the smaller
      physical-address space.
      </p>

      <h4>Virtual Memory</h4>
      <p>Software uses virtual addresses to access locations within the
      virtual-memory space. System software is responsible for managing the
      relocation of applications and data in virtual-memory space using
      segment-memory management and for mapping virtual memory to physical
      memory through the use of page translation.
      </p>

      <p>The x86_64 architecture supports different virtual-memory sizes using
      the following address-translation modes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Protected Mode</i> — This mode supports 4 gigabytes of virtual-address
          space using 32-bit virtual addresses.</li>
        <li><i>Long Mode</i> — This mode supports 16 exabytes of virtual-address
          space using 64-bit virtual addresses.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Physical Memory</h4>
      <p>Physical addresses are used to directly access main memory.
      For a particular computer system, the size of the available physical-address
      space is equal to the amount of main memory installed in the system.
      The maximum amount of physical memory accessible depends on the
      processor implementation and on the address-translation mode.
      </p>

      <p>The x86_64 architecture supports varying physical-memory sizes using
      the following address-translation modes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Real-Address Mode</i> — This mode, also called real mode, supports
          1 megabyte of physical-address space using 20-bit physical addresses.
          Real mode is available only from legacy mode.</li>
        <li><p><i>Legacy Protected Mode</i> — This mode supports several different
          address-space sizes, depending on the translation mechanism used
          and whether extensions to those mechanisms are enabled.
          </p>
          
          <p>Legacy protected mode supports 4 gigabytes of physical-address space
          using 32-bit physical addresses. Both segment translation can be used to
          access the physical address space, when the processor is running in
          legacy protected mode.</p>
          
          <p>When the physical-address size extensions (PAE) are enabled,
          the page-translation mechanism can be extended to support 52-bit physical
          addresses. 52-bit physical addresses allow up to 4 petabytes of
          physical-address space to be supported.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><i>Long Mode</i> — This mode is unique to the x86_64 architecture and
          supports up to 4 petabytes of physical-address space using
          52-bit physical addresses. Long mode requires the use of
          page-translation and the physical-address size extensions (PAE).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.1.3 Canonical Address Form</h3>
      <p>Long mode defines 64 bits of virtual-address space, but processor
      implementations can support less. Although some processor implementations
      do not use all 64 bits of the virtual address, they all check bits 63 through
      the most-significant implemented bit to see if those bits are all zeros
      or all ones. An address that complies with this property is in
      <i>canonical address form</i>.
      </p>

      <p>In most cases, a virtual-memory reference that is not in canonical form
      causes a general-protection exception (#GP) to occur. However, implied stack
      references where the stack address is not in canonical form causes a
      stack exception (#SS) to occur. Implied stack references include all push
      and pop instructions, and any instruction using RSP or RBP as a base register.
      </p>
