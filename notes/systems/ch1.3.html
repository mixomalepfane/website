      <h2>1.3. Operating Modes</h2>
      <p>The legacy x86 architecture provides four operating modes or environments
      that support varying forms of memory management, virtual-memory and
      physical-memory sizes, and protection:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real Mode</li>
        <li>Protected Mode</li>
        <li>Virtual-8086 Mode</li>
        <li>System Management Mode</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The x86_6464 architecture supports all these legacy modes, and it adds
      a new operating mode called long mode.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3.1 Long Mode</h3>
      <p>Long mode consists of two submodes: <i>64-bit mode</i> and
      <i>compatibility mode</i>. 64-bit mode supports several new features,
      including the ability to address 64-bit virtual-address space. Compatibility
      mode provides binary compatibility with existing 16-bit and 32-bit
      applications when running on 64-bit system software.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3.2 64-Bit Mode</h3>
      <p>64-bit mode, a submode of long mode, provides support for 64-bit system
      software and applications by adding the following features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>64-bit virtual addresses (processor implementations can have fewer).</li>
        <li>Access to General Purpose Register bits 63:32</li>
        <li>Access to additional registers through the REX, VEX, and XOP instruction
          prefixes:
          <ul>
            <li>eight additional GPRs (R8–R15)</li>
            <li>eight additional Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) registers (YMM/XMM8–15)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>64-bit instruction pointer (RIP).</li>
        <li>New RIP-relative data-addressing mode.</li>
        <li>Flat-segment address space with single code, data, and stack space.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The mode is enabled by the system software on an individual code-segment
      basis. Although code segments are used to enable and disable 64-bit mode,
      the legacy segmentation mechanism is largely disabled. Page translation is
      required for memory management purposes. Because 64-bit mode supports a
      64-bit virtual-address space, it requires 64-bit system software and
      development tools.
      </p>

      <p>In 64-bit mode, the default address size is 64 bits, and the default
      operand size is 32 bits. The defaults can be overridden on an
      instruction-by-instruction basis using instruction prefixes.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3.3 Compatibility Mode</h3>
      <p>Compatibility mode, a submode of long mode, allows system software to
      implement binary compatibility with existing 16-bit and 32-bit x86
      applications. It allows these applications to run, without recompilation,
      under 64-bit system software in long mode.
      </p>

      <p>In compatibility mode, applications can only access the first 4 GB of
      virtual-address space. Standard x86 instruction prefixes toggle between
      16-bit and 32-bit address and operand sizes.
      </p>

      <p>Compatibility mode, like 64-bit mode, is enabled by system software on
      an individual code-segment basis. Unlike 64-bit mode, however, segmentation
      functions the same as in the legacy x86 architecture, using 16-bit or
      32-bit protected-mode semantics. From an application viewpoint, compatibility
      mode looks like a legacy protected-mode environment. From a system-software
      viewpoint, the long-mode mechanisms are used for address translation, interrupt
      and exception handling, and system data-structures.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3.4 Legacy Modes</h3>
      <p><i>Legacy mode</i> consists of three submodes:
      <i>real mode, protected mode,</i> and <i>virtual-8086 mode</i>. Protected
      mode can be either paged or unpaged. Legacy mode preserves binary
      compatibility not only with existing x86 16-bit and 32-bit applications
      but also with existing x86 16-bit and 32-bit system software.
      </p>

      <h4>Real Mode</h4>
      <p>In this mode, also called real-address mode, the processor supports a
      physical-memory space of 1 MB and operand sizes of 16-bits (default) or
      32-bits (with instruction prefixes). Interrupt handling and address
      generation are nearly identical to the 80286 processor's real mode. Paging
      is not supported. All software runs at privilege level 0.</p>

      <p>Real mode is entered after reset or processor power-up. The mode is not
      supported when the processor is operating in long mode because long mode
      requires that paged protected mode be enabled.
      </p>

      <h4>Protected Mode</h4>
      <p>In this mode, the processor supports virtual-memory and physical-memory
      spaces of 4 GB and operand sizes of 16 or 32 bits. All segment translation,
      segment protection, and hardware multitasking functions are available.
      </p>

      <p>System software can use segmentation to relocate effective addresses
      in virtual-address space. If paging is not enabled, virtual addresses
      are equal to physical addresses. Paging can be optionally enabled to allow
      translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses and to use the
      page-based memory-protection mechanisms.
      </p>

      <p>In protected mode, software runs at privilege levels 0, 1, 2, or 3.
      Typically, application software runs at privilege level 3, the system
      software runs at privilege levels 0 and 1, and privilege level 2 is available
      to system software for other uses.
      </p>

      <h3>Virtual-8086 Mode</h3>
      <p>Virtual-8086 mode allows system software to run 16-bit real-mode software
      on a virtualized-8086 processor. In this mode, software written for the 8086,
      8088, 80186, or 80188 processor can run as a privilege-level-3 task under
      protected mode. The processor supports a virtual-memory space of 1 MB and
      operand sizes of 16 bits (default) or 32 bits (with instruction prefixes),
      and it uses real-mode address translation.
      </p>

      <p>Virtual-8086 mode is not supported when the processor is operating in
      long mode. When long mode is enabled, any attempt to enable virtual-8086
      mode is silently ignored.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3.5 System Management Mode (SMM)</h3>
      <p>System management mode (SMM) is an operating mode designed for
      system-control activities that are typically transparent to conventional
      system software. Power management is one popular use for system management
      mode. SMM is primarily targeted for use by platform firmware and specialized
      low-level device drivers. The code and data for SMM are stored in the
      SMM memory area, which is isolated from main memory by the SMM output signal.
      </p>

      <p>SMM is entered by way of a system management interrupt (SMI). Upon
      recognizing an SMI, the processor enters SMM and switches to a separate
      address space where the SMM handler is located and executes. In SMM, the
      processor supports real-mode addressing with 4 GB segment limits and
      default operand, address, and stack sizes of 16 bits
      (prefixes can be used to override these defaults).
