      <h2>1.2. Memory Management</h2>
      <p>Memory management consists of the methods by which addresses generated
      by software are translated by segmentation and/or paging into addresses
      in physical memory. Memory management is not visible to application software.
      It is handled by the system software and processor hardware.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2.1 Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Segmentation was originally created as a method by which system software
      could isolate software processes (tasks), and the data used by those processes,
      from one another in an effort to increase the reliability of systems running
      multiple processes simultaneously.
      </p>

      <p>Segmentation is a form of base memory-addressing that allows software
      and data to be relocated in virtual-address space off of an arbitrary base
      address. Software and data can be relocated in virtual-address space using
      one or more variable-sized <i>memory segments</i>. The legacy x86 architecture
      provides several methods of restricting access to segments from other segments
      so that software and data can be protected from interfering with each other.
      </p>

      <p>In compatibility and legacy modes, up to 16,383 unique segments can be
      defined. The base-address value, segment size (called a <i>limit</i>),
      protection, and other attributes for each segment are contained in a data
      structure called a <i>segment descriptor</i>. Collections of segment
      descriptors are held in <i>descriptor tables</i>. Specific segment descriptors
      are referenced or selected from the descriptor table using a <i>segment selector
      register</i>. Six segment-selector registers are available, providing access to
      as many as six segments at a time.
      </p>

      </div>
 
      <h4>Flat Segmentation</h4>
      <p>One special case of segmented memory is the flat-memory model. In the
      legacy flat-memory model, all segment-base addresses have a value of 0,
      and the segment limits are fixed at 4 GB. Segmentation cannot be disabled
      but use of the flat-memory model effectively disables segment translation.
      The result is a virtual address that equals the effective address.
      </p>

      <p>Software running in 64-bit mode automatically uses the flat-memory model.
      In 64-bit mode, the segment base is treated as if it were 0, and the segment
      limit is ignored. This allows an effective addresses to access the full
      virtual-address space supported by the processor.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2.2 Paging</h3>
      <p>Paging allows software and data to be relocated in physical-address space
      using fixed-size blocks called <i>physical pages</i>. The legacy x86
      architecture supports three different physical-page sizes of 4 KB, 2 MB, and
      4 MB. As with segment translation, access to physical pages by
      lesser-privileged software can be restricted.
      </p>

      <p>Page translation uses a hierarchical data structure called a
      <i>page-translation table</i> to translate virtual pages into physical-pages.
      The number of levels in the translation-table hierarchy can be as few as one
      or as many as four, depending on the physical-page size and processor
      operating mode. Translation tables are aligned on 4 KB boundaries.
      Physical pages must be aligned on 4 KB, 2 MB, or 4 MB boundaries,
      depending on the physical-page size.
      </p>

      <p>Each table in the translation hierarchy is indexed by a portion of the
      virtual-address bits. The entry referenced by the table index contains a
      pointer to the base address of the next-lower-level table in the translation
      hierarchy. In the case of the lowest-level table, its entry points to the
      physical-page base address. The physical page is then indexed by the
      least-significant bits of the virtual address to yield the physical address.
      </p>
      Paged Memory Model
      <div class="container">
        <img src="../../images/systems/f1.3.png" alt="figure 1.3" class="figures3"/>
      </div>

      <p>Software running in long mode is required to have page translation enabled.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2.3 Mixing Segmentation and Paging</h3>
      <p>Memory-management software can combine the use of segmented memory
      and paged memory. Because segmentation cannot be disabled, paged-memory
      management requires some minimum initialization of the segmentation resources.
      Paging can be completely disabled, so segmented-memory management does
      not require initialization of the paging resources.
      </p>

      <p>Segments can range in size from a single byte to 4 GB in length.
      It is therefore possible to map multiple segments to a single physical page
      and to map multiple physical pages to a single segment. Alignment between
      segment and physical-page boundaries is not required, but memory-management
      software is simplified when segment and physical-page boundaries are aligned.
      </p>

      <p>Because 64-bit mode disables segmentation, it uses a flat, paged-memory
      model for memory management. The 4 Gbyte segment limit is ignored in
      64-bit mode.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2.4 Real Addressing</h3>
      <p>Real addressing is a legacy-mode form of address translation used in
      real mode. In this mode, 16-bit effective addresses are mapped to 20-bit
      physical addresses, providing a 1 MB physical-address space.
      </p>

      <p>Segment selectors are used in real-address translation, but not as an
      index into a descriptor table. Instead, the 16-bit segment-selector value
      is shifted left by 4 bits to form a 20-bit segment-base address. The 16-bit
      effective address is added to this 20-bit segment base address to yield
      a 20-bit physical address.
      </p>

      <p>Real-address translation supports a 1 MB physical-address space using
      up to 64 KB segments aligned on 16-byte boundaries. Each segment is exactly
      64 KB long.
      </p>
