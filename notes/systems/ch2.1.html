      <h2>2.1. Real Mode Segmentation</h2>
      <p>After reset or power-up, the processor always initially enters real mode.
      Protected modes are entered from real mode.
      </p>

      <p>Real mode (real-address mode), provides a physical-memory space of 1 MB.
      In this mode, a 20-bit physical address is determined by shifting a 16-bit
      segment selector to the left four bits and adding the 16-bit effective address.
      </p>

      <p>Each segment (CS, DS, ES, FS, GS, SS) is aligned on 16-byte boundaries.
      The segment base is the lowest address in a given segment, and is equal to
      the <i>segment selector * 16</i>. The POP and MOV instructions can be used to
      load a (possibly) new segment selector into one of the segment registers.
      </p>

      <p>When this occurs, the selector is updated and the segment base is set to
      <i>selector * 16</i>. The segment limit and segment attributes are unchanged,
      but are normally 64 KB (the maximum allowable limit) and read/write data,
      respectively.
      </p>

      <p>On FAR transfers, CS (code segment) selector is updated to the new value,
      and the CS segment base is set to <i>selector * 16</i>. The CS segment limit
      and attributes are unchanged, but are usually 64 KB and read/write,
      respectively.
      </p>
