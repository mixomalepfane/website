      <h2>2.5. Segment Selectors and Registers</h2>

      <h3>2.5.1 Segment Selectors</h3>
      <p>Segment selectors are pointers to specific entries in the
      global and local descriptor tables.
      </p>

      <i>Segment Selector</i>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="../../images/systems/f2.1.png" alt="figure 2.1" class="figures2"/>
      </div>

      The selector format consists of the following fields:
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Selector Index Field</b> - Bits 15:3. The selector-index field
          specifies an entry in the descriptor table. Descriptor-table entries are
          eight bytes long, so the selector index is scaled by 8 to form a byte
          offset into the descriptor table. The offset is then added to either
          the global or local descriptor-table base address
          (as indicated by the table-index bit) to form the descriptor-entry address
          in virtual-address space.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li><p><b>Table Indicator (TI) Bit</b> - Bit 2. The TI bit indicates which
          table holds the descriptor referenced by the selector index. When TI=0
          the GDT is used and when TI=1 the LDT is used. The descriptor-table base
          address is read from the appropriate descriptor-table register and added
          to the scaled selector index as described above.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li><p><b>Requestor Privilege-Level (RPL) Field</b> - Bits 1:0. The RPL
          represents the privilege level (CPL) the processor is operating under
          at the time the selector is created. RPL is used in segment privilege-checks
          to prevent software running at lesser privilege levels from accessing
          privileged data.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li><p><b>Null Selector</b> - Null selectors have a selector index of 0 and TI=0,
          corresponding to the first entry in the GDT. However, null selectors do not
          reference the first GDT entry but are instead used to invalidate unused segment
          registers. A general-protection exception (#GP) occurs if a reference is
          made to use a segment register containing a null selector in non-64-bit mode.
          By initializing unused segment registers with null selectors software can trap
          references to unused segments.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.5.2 Segment Registers</h3>
      <p>Six 16-bit segment registers are provided for referencing up to six segments
      at one time. All software tasks require segment selectors to be loaded in the
      CS and SS registers. Use of the DS, ES, FS, and GS segments is optional,
      but nearly all software accesses data and therefore requires a selector in
      the DS register.
      </p>

      <table>
        Segment Registers
        <tr>
          <th>Segment Register</th>
          <th>Encoding</th>
          <th>Segment Register Function</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>ES</td><td>/0</td>
          <td>References optional data-segment descriptor entry</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>CS</td><td>/1</td>
          <td>References code-segment descriptor entry</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>SS</td><td>/2</td>
          <td>References stack segment descriptor entry</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>DS</td><td>/3</td>
          <td>References default data-segment descriptor entry</td>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
          <td>FS</td><td>/4</td>
          <td>References optional data-segment descriptor entry</td>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>

        </tr>
   
      </table>

      <p>The processor maintains a hidden portion of the segment register in addition
      to the selector value loaded by software. This hidden portion contains the values
      found in the descriptor-table entry referenced by the segment selector. The
      processor loads the descriptor-table entry into the hidden portion when the segment
      register is loaded. By keeping the corresponding descriptor-table entry in hardware,
      performance is optimized for the majority of memory references.
      </p>

      <i>Segment-Register Format</i>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="../../images/systems/f2.2.png" alt="figure 2.2" class="figures2"/>
      </div>

      <h4>CS Register</h4>
      <p>The CS register contains the segment selector referencing the current
      code-segment descriptor entry. All instruction fetches reference the CS descriptor.
      When a new selector is loaded into the CS register, the current-privilege level
      (CPL) of the processor is set to that of the CS-segment descriptor-privilege
      level (DPL).
      </p>

      <h4>Data-Segment Registers</h4>
      <p>The DS register contains the segment selector referencing the default
      data-segment descriptor entry. The SS register contains the stack-segment selector.
      The ES, FS, and GS registers are optionally loaded with segment selectors
      referencing other data segments. Data accesses default to referencing the DS
      descriptor except in the following two cases:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The ES descriptor is referenced for string-instruction destinations.</li>
        <li>The SS descriptor is referenced for stack operations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.5.3 Segment Registers in 64-Bit Mode</h3>

      <h4>CS Register in 64-Bit Mode</h4>
      <p>In 64-bit mode, most of the hidden portion of the CS register is ignored.
      Only the L (long), D (default operation size), and DPL (descriptor privilege-level)
      attributes are recognized by 64-bit mode. Address calculations assume a CS.base
      value of 0. CS references do not check the CS.limit value, but instead check that
      the effective address is in canonical form.
      </p>

      <h4>DS, ES, and SS Registers in 64-Bit Mode</h4>
      <p>In 64-bit mode, the contents of the ES, DS, and SS segment registers are ignored.
      All fields (base, limit, and attribute) in the hidden portion of the segment
      registers are ignored.
      </p>

      <p>Address calculations in 64-bit mode that reference the ES, DS, or SS segments
      are treated as if the segment base is 0. Instead of performing limit checks,
      the processor checks that all virtual-address references are in canonical form.
      </p>

      <p>Neither enabling and activating long mode nor switching between 64-bit and
      compatibility modes changes the contents of the visible or hidden portions of the
      segment registers. These registers remain unchanged during 64-bit mode execution
      unless explicit segment loads are performed.
      </p>

      <h4>FS and GS Registers in 64-Bit Mode</h4>
      <p>Unlike the CS, DS, ES, and SS segments, the FS and GS segment overrides can be
      used in 64-bit mode. When FS and GS segment overrides are used in 64-bit mode,
      their respective base addresses are used in the effective-address (EA) calculation.
      The complete EA calculation then becomes</p>

      <p><i>(FS or GS).base + base + (scale * index) + displacement</i></p>

      <p>The FS.base and GS.base
      values are also expanded to the full 64-bit virtual-address size.
      </p>
      <i>FS and GS Segment-Register Formatâ€”64-Bit Mode</i>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="../../images/systems/f2.3.png" alt="figure 2.3" class="figures3"/>
      </div>

      <p>In 64-bit mode, FS-segment and GS-segment overrides are not checked for limit
      or attributes. Instead, the processor checks that all virtual-address references
      are in canonical form.
      </p>

      <p>Segment register-load instructions (MOV to Sreg and POP Sreg) load only a
      32-bit base-address value into the hidden portion of the FS and GS segment
      registers. The base-address bits above the low 32 bits are cleared to 0 as a
      result of a segment-register load. When a null selector is loaded into FS or GS,
      the contents of the corresponding hidden descriptor register are not altered.
      </p>

      <p>There are two methods to update the contents of the FS.base and GS.base hidden
      descriptor fields. The first is available exclusively to privileged software
      (CPL = 0). The FS.base and GS.base hidden descriptor-register fields are mapped
      to MSRs. Privileged software can load a 64-bit base address in canonical form
      into FS.base or GS.base using a single WRMSR instruction. The FS.base MSR address
      is C000_0100h while the GS.base MSR address is C000_0101h.
      </p>

      <p>The second method of updating the FS and GS base fields is available to
      software running at any privilege level (when supported by the implementation and
      enabled by setting CR4[FSGSBASE]). The WRFSBASE and WRGSBASE instructions copy
      the contents of a GPR to the FS.base and GS.base fields respectively. When the
      operand size is 32 bits, the upper doubleword of the base is cleared.
      WRFSBASE and WRGSBASE are only supported in 64-bit mode.
      </p>

      <p>The addresses written into the expanded FS.base and GS.base registers must be
      in canonical form. Any instruction that attempts to write a non-canonical address
      to these registers causes a general-protection exception (#GP) to occur.
      </p>

      <p>When in compatibility mode, the FS and GS overrides operate as defined by the
      legacy x86 architecture regardless of the value loaded into the high 32 bits of
      the hidden descriptor-register base-address field. Compatibility mode ignores
      the high 32 bits when calculating an effective address.
      </p>
